## Project Status

This project is currently in its final stages of development and is almost complete. However, I'm currently working on implementing three important features:

- Sanitization: to make sure that the input data is properly sanitized to prevent any security issues
- Optimistic Updates: to make the user interface more responsive and provide a better user experience
- User Authentication: to ensure that only authorized users can access certain features and data
