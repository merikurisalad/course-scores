## Project Status

Updated in April, 2025: This project was previously deployed on Netlify, with its database hosted on Heroku. However, since the free tier is no longer available on Heroku, I have taken the project offline. I don’t plan to redeploy it at this time, but you're welcome to check out the local version by cloning the repository and running it locally.

## Project Reflections

While I’m no longer actively developing new features, there are a few improvements I would have liked to implement if I continued working on it:

- Sanitization: to make sure that the input data is properly sanitized to prevent any security issues
- Optimistic Updates: to make the user interface more responsive and provide a better user experience
- User Authentication: to ensure that only authorized users can access certain features and data
